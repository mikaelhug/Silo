# STATUS.md — Silo live ledger

> Updated every iteration. `CLAUDE.md` is the contract; this is the state.

## Now
- **M68–M72 — REVERT to the Steam-bottle model + a 3-round agentic audit.** 115 tests / 26 suites green;
  clean build (no warnings). SteamCMD + macOS credential-seeding were removed and the app reverted to a
  single shared **Steam bottle**: one Wine prefix hosting a logged-in Windows Steam client; games install
  there and launch **co-resident** under GPTK/D3DMetal so Steamworks/DRM works (IPC is prefix-scoped). Then
  an agentic audit-fix loop (4 read-only audits → verify → apply → re-audit):
  - **M68:** the revert itself (bottle foundation, discovery from the bottle's `appmanifest`, launchInBottle).
  - **M69:** removed the dead isolated-prefix layer (PrefixProvisioner, GameLogStore, SteamBottle.launchGame,
    AppPaths.prefix/prefixesDir, RuntimeManager.installedRuntimes/availableAssets, SteamApp.downloadProgress/
    needsUpdate). Bottle now launches Steam in a Wine **virtual desktop** (`explorer /desktop=`) with
    overlay-disable overrides + msync; `play()` brings Steam up ONCE (tracked PID) with a cold-start grace.
    Wine build: add `CROSSCFLAGS=-fvisibility=default`; drop `/usr/local/lib` from the DYLD fallback (it
    leaked Homebrew's duplicate gtk → the "implemented in both" crash seen launching bottle Steam).
  - **M70:** removed the now-obsolete `.sharedSteamClient` strategy + unused `Receipt`/`revert` (the bottle
    IS the in-prefix Steam); `load()` surfaces real discovery errors instead of swallowing them.
  - **M71:** force msync for every bottle game launch (a per-game esync/none would fork a 2nd wineserver and
    break Steamworks); `steam://` install/uninstall deliver via single-instance forwarding (no 2nd Steam in
    a duplicate desktop); GraphicsLinker scoped to `d3d*`/`dxgi*` so it can't clobber the shared bottle;
    removed the orphaned `WineRuntime` type.
  - **M72:** `stop()` also `wine taskkill /F /IM <game exe>` in the bottle's msync wineserver so a
    child/relauncher game isn't orphaned (Steam untouched — different image names).
- **M58–M60 COMPLETE — spring cleaning.** 150 tests / 30 suites green; clean build (no warnings).
  Three parallel audits (dead code / duplication / post-pivot vestigial) → verified findings → acted.
  - **M58:** Uninstall also removes the game's isolated Wine prefix (full reclaim).
  - **M59 (dedup):** SteamAppInfo.headerArtURL/storePageURL (views stop hand-rolling URLs); one
    GameArtworkPlaceholder; one URL.tailString; shared .uninstallConfirmation modifier; LogTarget.windowID
    + AppEnvironment.logTarget(for:).
  - **M60 (removals):** deleted zero-ref dead symbols + post-pivot vestigial code (masterBottlePath/
    steamRoot/steamWineBinaryPath/isMasterBottleConfigured/steamWine, DiscoveryEngine.steamRoot(inBottle:),
    Silo.steamInstallerURL/steamLaunchArgs, AppPaths.masterBottleDefault, WineRuntime.wineserverBinary,
    PrefixLayout.syswow64/dosDevices, StateFlags.isDownloading, SteamApp URL helpers, requiresUserStub),
    removed CrashLoopGuard + orphaned ProcessRunning.processCount, hid the inert .sharedSteamClient from
    the picker, reworded stale Master-bottle docs. Net −156 lines (5045→4940 LOC) despite adding helpers.
- **M51–M57 COMPLETE — perf + reliability + UX pass.** 153 tests / 31 suites green; clean build (no
  warnings); .app assembles; verified running at **0.0% idle CPU** (was pinned at 100%).
  - **M51 (the energy bug):** sampled the live app → main thread pinned in SwiftUI layout driven by a
    CADisplayLink. Root cause: indeterminate `ProgressView()` spinners INSIDE the ScrollView (loading /
    "Updating" / AsyncImage placeholder) re-laid out the whole grid every frame. Moved spinners out of
    the scroll content; download bar `safeAreaInset`→VStack sibling; `filtered` no longer re-sorts.
    Verified 100%→0%.
  - **M52 (event-driven, no polling):** `ProcessRunning` gains `observeExit` (DispatchSource process) +
    `observeWrites` (file-system) + `firstPID`. Downloads read progress reactively from the SteamCMD log
    and detect completion/interruption from the process's real exit (no 2s poll, no flaky pgrep) — fixes
    the false "Resume"; manifest is authoritative on exit. Game-exit clears state via an exit observer.
  - **M53 (UX):** whole card opens details; detail view shows Disk size / Metacritic / Minimum
    requirements; status messages auto-dismiss (6s); refresh toolbar keeps button chrome while spinning.
    Fixed logged-in account "falling away" — `autodetect` was wiping `steamUsername`; now preserved + the
    account shows in the navigation subtitle.
  - **M54:** Uninstall (menu + details, confirmed) deletes the game's bucket files.
  - **M55:** fast refresh — incremental app-metadata cache (`ownedGames(known:)` only `app_info`s new
    apps; the cache persists the full owned catalog).
  - **M56:** `BackendPolicy` — GPTK default for DirectX 9–12, auto CrossOver fallback when GPTK absent;
    detail view shows the recommended backend + DirectX-derived rationale.
  - **M57:** log viewer is now a kqueue file-watcher (was a 1s poll). No timer/poll loops remain anywhere.
- **M0–M41 COMPLETE — pivot DONE.** 137 tests / 29 suites green; clean build (no warnings); .app assembles.
- **PIVOT COMPLETE (M36–M41):** Wine Steam-client GUI fully removed; replaced by native-macOS SteamCMD.
  - M37–M38: SteamCMDClient (install + force-windows download + capture) + SteamAppInfo metadata +
    ownedWindowsGames enumeration (licenses→packages→app_info, filtered to windows-only games).
  - M39: SyncMode enum, MSync default (Apple-Silicon best practice).
  - M40: GameLibraryViewModel + SteamLoginViewModel wired into AppEnvironment (account in BackendConfig).
  - M41 (UI swap + rip-out): new SteamLoginView + SteamGameTileView; LibraryGridView lists owned
    Windows-only games (Download→SteamCMD, Play→GPTK bucket); OnboardingView step 3 = "Sign in to Steam";
    readiness = wineReady && gptkReady && steamLoggedIn. DELETED: SteamBottleInstaller, SteamCardView,
    GameCardView, LibraryViewModel, SteamLibraryInstaller, OwnedAppsReader (+ their tests). ViewModelTests
    pruned to the surviving VMs. CrashLoopGuard retained (available; no longer wired to Steam GUI).
  - REMAINING (human-gated): real SteamCMD login + a real Windows-only game download → launch in a GPTK
    bucket (needs the user's Steam credentials). All headless-testable logic is done + green.
- **>>> ARCHITECTURE PIVOT (2026-06-27, user decision) <<<** The Wine **Steam-client GUI** does not
  render under our self-built wine on macOS 26 (CEF black window; verified that -no-cef-sandbox fixes the
  crash-loop but neither GPU-on nor GPU-off nor RetinaMode nor virtual-desktop renders it — this is the
  industry-wide problem that got Whisky archived). New model **"Native Steam library → SteamCMD → GPTK
  buckets"**: (1) DROP the Wine Steam bottle entirely (SteamBottleInstaller/openSteam/CEF flags/shared-
  client presence); (2) library = the user's owned games filtered to **Windows-only** (no native mac
  build); (3) download via **native macOS SteamCMD** `@sSteamCmdForcePlatformType windows` (no Wine/CEF);
  (4) launch each in a per-game **GPTK bucket** configured from the game's Steam metadata (DirectX→backend)
  else sensible default. Owned-list + metadata via SteamCMD itself (licenses_print / app_info_print) — no
  Web API key needed.
  - P0 DONE: native macOS SteamCMD **verified on macOS 26** (bootstraps, accepts force-windows, returns
    app_info platforms for appID 70).
  - M36 / P1-foundation DONE: `SteamCMD` pure command builders (download / app_info / licenses) + tests.
  - TODO: P1 `SteamCMDClient` (install steamcmd + run download/login via ProcessRunning); P2 owned
    Windows-only library + metadata; P3 metadata-driven GPTK bucket; P4 rip out old Steam-bottle code + UI rework.
- M35 = bundler no longer bundles glib/gstreamer/ffmpeg media stack (killed the "implemented in both" +
  glib-type dup warnings); 44→21 libs; clean wineboot = 0 freetype + 0 dup. RetinaMode reverted (broke windowing).
- M33 (user UX/bug fixes): (1) Steam card now has a right-click context menu + always-visible ellipsis
  (Open Steam, Reinstall, View Log…, Wine Config…, Reveal Bottle, Settings…). (2) Log viewer opens as a
  STANDALONE WINDOW (WindowGroup id "silo-log" + openWindow), not a modal sheet, so it live-tails while
  you drive the main window; generalized to any file (title+url), added an Autoscroll toggle. (3) (b)
  CrashLoopGuard + ProcessRunning.processCount: auto `wineserver -k` if a `winedbg` storm appears, wired
  behind openSteam. (4) (a) gstreamer dedup: reorder to bundled-LAST was tried but BREAKS FreeType
  (wine only finds its dlopen'd freetype from the bundle), so kept bundled-FIRST; proper dedup = don't
  bundle the glib/gstreamer/ffmpeg media stack (TODO in bundler; only manifests during video playback).
- **OPEN (windowing):** Steam launches but renders as two blank/black rootless windows (steam + CEF
  steamwebhelper). Testing a wine VIRTUAL DESKTOP (HKCU\Software\Wine\Explorer Desktop=Default) to
  composite into one window — enabled on the user's bottle; awaiting visual confirmation it renders.
- M32 (bug: "Open Steam" opens nothing): Steam WAS launching but its CEF UI renderer went
  "unresponsive" and Steam killed+relaunched it every ~90s forever, so the window stayed 0x0/blank.
  Root cause: the CEF sandbox under wine. Fix: `Silo.steamLaunchArgs` now passes `-no-cef-sandbox`
  (+ `-cef-disable-gpu -allosarches`; dropped obsolete `-cef-force-32bit`). EMPIRICALLY VERIFIED on
  the user's machine: 0 "unresponsive" events after relaunch and a real 705x440 Steam login window appeared.
- M31 (bug: can't right-click library cards): GameCardView had only the ellipsis `Menu`, no
  `.contextMenu`. Added a right-click menu (Play/Stop, Isolate, Settings…, View Log…, Reveal Prefix,
  Wine Config…, View on Steam Store, Reset Prefix) via a shared `managementMenu()` builder reused by
  the ellipsis menu, which is now always visible (even while running). Per-game settings pane gained
  **Launch options** (`GameConfig.launchOptionsString` ↔ `customArgs`, Steam-style) and a DXVK HUD
  field (CrossOver backend only). `SteamApp.storePageURL` added. +3 tests.
- M30 (bug: Install Steam hung + crash storm): the silent `SteamSetup.exe /S` auto-launches Steam.exe,
  which crash-loops under wine (Steam CEF) and spawns *hundreds* of `winedbg --auto` processes, so the
  installer NEVER returns → app stuck "Installing…", `masterBottlePath` never set. Fix: `SteamBottleInstaller`
  now SPAWNS the installer detached, polls for `Steam.exe` to appear (≤180s), then `wineserver -k`s the
  bottle so the crash-loop can't accumulate; full client downloads on first real run via "Open Steam"
  (which passes CEF-safe flags). Verified on the user's machine: bottle + Steam.exe present; storm killed.
- M29 (D3DMetal path wiring): GPTK game launches now (a) put GPTK's `lib/external` on
  `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` + `DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH` so `d3d11.so` resolves
  `@rpath/libd3dshared.dylib` and `D3DMetal.framework`; (b) add GPTK's `lib/wine` to `WINEDLLPATH`
  and force d3d/dxgi `=b` (builtin) so wine loads GPTK's d3d instead of the base wine's. New
  `BackendConfig.gptkExternalDirPath` / `gptkWineDLLDirPath` derive these from `gptkLibDirPath`.
  STATICALLY VERIFIED on the real GPTK-4.0_beta_1: D3DMetal.framework loads under x86_64; converter
  libs (libmetalirconverter/libdxccontainer) resolve via the framework's own rpath; wine honors
  DYLD_FALLBACK (proven by the freetype fix). **E2E activation is human-gated** (see BLOCKED).
- M28 (self-contained wine): `Scripts/bundle-wine-dylibs.sh` copies the transitive closure of wine's
  non-system dylib deps (arch-filtered to the wine's arch — x86_64) into `<wine>/lib/silo-bundled`;
  the app launches wine with `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=<…>/lib/silo-bundled` (URL.siloDyldFallback)
  so freetype/gstreamer/etc. resolve without Homebrew. Wired into build-wine (CI + local) + install-
  local-wine. **VERIFIED**: wineboot with the app's exact env → 0 FreeType warnings, prefix boots.
- M27 (bug: "Install Steam does nothing"): first-run `wineboot` was hanging on blocking wine-mono/
  wine-gecko install dialogs. Now `wineboot` (SteamBottleInstaller + PrefixProvisioner) sets
  `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=mscoree,mshtml=` (`Silo.winePrefixInitOverrides`) so it completes headlessly.
  Verified: the user's wine-cx-26.2.0 boots a home-dir prefix cleanly with the override.
- **KNOWN (build follow-up):** the locally-built wine logs "cannot find the FreeType font library" —
  the self-built wine depends on Homebrew dylibs (freetype/gstreamer/…) not bundled/relocated, so it's
  not fully self-contained. Prefix creation still works; fonts won't render until deps are bundled.
- CI FIX: `Scripts/test.sh` crashed on the runner (bash 3.2 + `set -u` + empty `FLAGS` array →
  "unbound variable"); now guards the empty-array expansion. (This was failing every CI run.)
- M26 = game artwork: `SteamApp.headerArtURL` (Steam CDN header.jpg); GameCardView shows the cover
  via AsyncImage with a gradient placeholder fallback.
- M25 (Wine Manager fixes from user report): `locateWineBinary` now excludes directories, so GPTK
  installs (`lib/wine` dir) no longer masquerade as Wine in the Wine tab; Wine tab simplified to a
  single "Install latest Wine" (dropped the broken multi-version refresh — CI publishes the canonical
  latest); removed a stray `Runtimes/GPTK` left by the M15 verification import.
- M24 = downloaded-Wine SHA-256 verification (build-wine publishes `.sha256`; RuntimeManager verifies).
- M23 = audit robustness + UX: downloaded Wine is
  de-quarantined + ad-hoc re-signed (Gatekeeper), extraction cleans up on failure; GPTK de-quarantined
  (no re-sign — keeps Apple's signature); live log tail; library recently-played sort + installed/updates
  filter; prefix management (reveal / Wine config / reset); CI concurrency + ccache + timeouts + read perms.
  **Perf levers (msync default, DXMT, rosettax87, DXVK install) still deferred — say "do perf" to start.**

- M22 = launch feedback + UX wins: Running/exited
  state + Stop button (`ProcessRunning.isRunning`, `LaunchOrchestrator.stop` via `wineserver -k`,
  `LibraryViewModel` PID monitor); `lastPlayed` stamped; `Updater` wired (bootstrap check → About
  "Update available"); exe **picker** in GameSettingsSheet (`ExecutableResolver.allExecutables`);
  library auto-refresh on app re-activation (scenePhase).

## Review backlog (remaining)
- PERF (deferred per user — say "do perf"): msync default-on (esync/msync mutually-exclusive enum);
  DXMT backend; rosettax87 fast x86; DXVK install path (the `.crossover` backend is unreachable on a clean install).
- HUMAN-GATED: notarization in release.yml (needs your Apple Developer ID + secrets).
- D3DMETAL PATH: DONE (M29). Runtime env wired + statically verified. Real activation needs a game launch (BLOCKED).
- NICE-TO-HAVE: pin GitHub Actions by commit SHA (clears Node-20 deprecation notice).
- All other audit findings (correctness, robustness, UX) are DONE (M21–M24). Wine sourcing architecture settled (see
  WINE-BUILD.md): self-hosted CrossOver-based Wine built in our own CI (`build-wine.yml`,
  workflow_dispatch) → published to our Releases → app pulls from `Silo.wineRepo` (= mikaelhug/Silo);
  no third-party prebuilt dependency. D3DMetal still imported from Apple's `.dmg`. Steam launches with
  CEF crash-workaround flags. **Perf work (DXMT/rosettax87/msync) deferred per user.**

## Wine strategy decision (2026-06-26) — see WINE-BUILD.md
- CrossOver's Wine is LGPL open source (what Apple's GPTK formula compiles). We build it ourselves in
  CI and host it, rather than depend on Gcenx/Sikarugir prebuilts (which can go stale). Don't build
  upstream Wine from scratch — perf comes from translation layers (D3DMetal/DXMT/DXVK) + x86 translator.
- **CI-gated:** `build-wine.yml` is a best-effort recipe NOT yet validated end-to-end; until the first
  `wine-*` release exists, the Wine tab is empty — use CrossOver (auto-detected) or override the path.
- **Pivot (user, 2026-06-26):** GPTK acquisition is "Browse to Apple `.dmg`" → Silo mounts + extracts
  `redist/lib`. VERIFIED against the real `Game_Porting_Toolkit_4.0_beta_1.dmg` (gitignored) via
  `silo --import-gptk <dmg>`: extracts D3DMetal.framework + 6 DLLs to Runtimes/GPTK (68M), clean detach.

## Research findings (2026-06-26, grounds M13–M16)
- `apple/game-porting-toolkit` is a **resources repo, no binary releases**; official GPTK = a DMG
  behind Apple-ID login (not automatable). **`Gcenx/game-porting-toolkit/releases`** has prebuilt
  GPTK binaries (no login) → use as the 1-click default; link Apple's repo for the manual route.
- Steam Windows installer: `https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/client/installer/SteamSetup.exe`
  (akamai mirror: `https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/SteamSetup.exe`), silent flag `/S`.
- No single "install whole library" command. Mechanism = `steam://install/<appid>` per owned app via
  the running Steam client; owned appids parsed from `userdata/*/config/localconfig.vdf`.
- "wine-mirror/wine" is source-only (no mac binaries) → it means "use a vanilla Wine runtime" as the
  Steam-bottle fallback when GPTK can't run the Steam client.

## Build/test snapshot
- `swift build`: ✅ clean (no warnings)

- Last green commit: M12 CI + release + README

## Task board

### DOING
- _(none)_

### TODO (in order; each ends in a green commit)
- _(none — all milestones complete)_

### DONE
- M0 — Scaffold SPM project + harness docs (Package.swift, silo/SiloKit/SiloKitTests, CLAUDE.md, STATUS.md, README, .gitignore, Scripts/test.sh).
- M1 — KeyValues tokenizer + parser + KVNode (`Discovery/{ACFTokenizer,KeyValuesParser,KVNode}.swift`; 14 parser/tokenizer tests).
- M2 — Models (`SteamApp`, `StateFlags`, `LibraryFolder`) + decoders (`AppManifestDecoder`, `LibraryFoldersDecoder`) + fixtures + `FixtureLoader`; 10 decoder tests.
- M3 — `DiscoveryEngine` (actor): scans primary + extra libraries, skips bad manifests; `TempDir` helper; 5 tests.
- M4 — Config models (`GraphicsBackend`, `SteamPresenceStrategy`, `EnvFlags`, `WineRuntime`, `BackendConfig`, `GameConfig`) + `AppPaths` + `AppState` + `ConfigStore` actor (JSON); 8 tests.
- M5 — `ProcessRunning` protocol + `ProcessResult` + `SystemProcessRunner` (temp-file redirect, env merge, detached spawn) + `FakeProcessRunner` (lock-guarded); 8 tests incl real subprocesses.
- M6 — `PrefixLayout`, `PrefixProvisioner` actor (idempotent wineboot --init), `GraphicsLinker` (symlink/copy GPTK or DXVK into system32); 9 tests. Note: Sendable structs use computed `FileManager.default` (can't store non-Sendable); actors may store it.
- M7 — `LaunchPlan`, pure `LaunchOrchestrator.makePlan` (static; isolated WINEPREFIX, backend env, DXVK overrides), `launch` pipeline (provision→link→log→spawn), `ExecutableResolver`, `GameLogStore`; GameConfig gained `executableRelativePath`; 12 tests.
- M8 — `BackendResolver` (Whisky/Kegworks/CrossOver detection, .none on clean machine) + `SteamPresenceInstaller` (none/appIDFile/sharedClient/emulatorStub with backup+revert), wired into launch pipeline; 10 tests.
- M9 — `GitHubRelease` model, `Updater` (GH Releases version check, numeric compare), `RuntimeManager` actor (list/fetch/download+tar-extract/remove); `FakeURLProtocol` test support; 9 tests. Note: Swift Testing runs in parallel — network tests use unique stub URLs (no shared-state reset).
- M10 — `AppEnvironment` composition root + `SiloApp` (SwiftUI App); view models (`LibraryViewModel`, `BackendSettingsViewModel`, `GameSettingsViewModel`, `RuntimeViewModel`); views (Root/Sidebar/LibraryGrid/GameCard/Badge/BackendSettings/RuntimeManager/GameSettingsSheet/LogViewer/About/PathPickerRow); `silo --smoke` headless path; 7 VM tests.
- M11 — `Resources/{Info.plist.template,silo.entitlements (no sandbox)}` + `Scripts/{build-app,sign,run,dev,clean}.sh`; assembles + ad-hoc signs `dist/Silo.app`, strips quarantine. Verified bundle valid + bundled binary smoke-runs.
- M12 — `.github/workflows/{ci,release}.yml` (build+test+bundle on push/PR; tag → ad-hoc-signed Silo.zip release) + README (build, first-run setup, sandbox, legal).
- M13 — App icon: CoreGraphics generator (`Scripts/make-icon.swift`) + `make-icon.sh` (sips/iconutil) -> `Resources/AppIcon.icns`; wired via `CFBundleIconFile`; bundled by build-app.sh.
- M14 — `SteamBottleInstaller` (boot bottle → download SteamSetup.exe → silent `/S` install) + `BackendConfig.steamWine` (vanilla fallback) + AppPaths.masterBottleDefault; "Create Master Steam Bottle (1-click)" button + VM; 4 tests.
- M15 — `GPTKImporter` (browse Apple .dmg → `hdiutil attach` outer+nested via plist → copy `redist/lib` → Runtimes/GPTK, set `gptkLibDirPath`); RuntimeVM.importGPTK + "Import GPTK from .dmg…" UI + Apple link; `silo --import-gptk` CLI; **verified on real GPTK 4.0 DMG**; 4 tests. Decision log: GPTK has no wine binary (overlay only); base wine still from CrossOver/download.
- M16 — `OwnedAppsReader` (parse userdata/*/config/localconfig.vdf owned appids) + `SteamLibraryInstaller` (queue `steam://install/<appid>` per owned app via wine); LibraryVM.installEntireLibrary + "Install entire library" toolbar button; localconfig.vdf fixture; 6 tests.
- M17 — GPTK Manager: versioned installs (`Runtimes/GPTK-<version>` from DMG name) via `GPTKImporter.runtimeName/installed/remove`; `GPTKInstall` model; `BackendConfig.gptkRuntimeName`; `GPTKManagerViewModel` (import/remove/set-default, auto-default on first import) + `GPTKManagerView` + sidebar "GPTK Manager". Moved GPTK import out of Wine Runtimes view. 5 new tests.
- M18 — Wine Manager (`WineManagerView` segmented GPTK|Wine tabs): GPTK tab = `GPTKManagerView`; Wine tab = `WineDownloadView` driven by rewritten `RuntimeViewModel` (latest 3 Gcenx releases, 1-click install, set-default, remove). `WineInstall` model; `RuntimeManager.availableReleases/preferredAsset/installWine/installedWines/locateWineBinary`; `BackendConfig.wineRuntimeName`; `Silo.wineRepo` (Gcenx, .tar.xz ~250MB). Backend view → "Setup" with Advanced disclosure for manual paths; deleted RuntimeManagerView; sidebar Library/Setup/Wine Manager/About. 3 new tests (109 total).
- M23 — Audit robustness+UX: RuntimeManager `harden` (xattr de-quarantine + ad-hoc codesign) + extraction cleanup; GPTKImporter de-quarantine; LogViewer live tail+autoscroll; LibraryViewModel SortOrder/Filter + lastPlayed map; PrefixProvisioner.remove + LaunchOrchestrator.runWineTool (winecfg) + GameCard prefix menu; CI concurrency/ccache/timeouts/read-perms; 3 tests (117 total).
- M22 — Launch feedback + UX: `ProcessRunning.isRunning(pid:)` (kill(pid,0)); `LaunchOrchestrator.stop` (wineserver -k); `LibraryViewModel` runningPIDs + monitor + Stop + `lastPlayed`; Updater wired into AppEnvironment/About; exe picker (`ExecutableResolver.allExecutables`); scenePhase auto-refresh; 3 new tests (116 total).
- M21 — Post-review correctness hardening (see git log).
- M20 — Wine sourcing architecture: `Silo.wineRepo` → self-hosted `mikaelhug/Silo` (removed stale Gcenx `defaultRuntimeRepo`/`gptkRepo`); `WINE-BUILD.md` decision doc; `.github/workflows/build-wine.yml` (CI builds CrossOver-base Wine from open source → our Releases; workflow_dispatch, needs CI iteration). Steam launches with `Silo.steamLaunchArgs` CEF flags (`openSteam`). 1 new test (112 total). Perf (DXMT/rosettax87/msync) deferred.
- M19 — Library-as-home: removed Setup sidebar pane. `OnboardingView` (3 StepRows: Install Wine/Import GPTK/Install Steam) shown when `AppEnvironment.setupComplete` is false; `SteamCardView` (Open Steam via `AppEnvironment.openSteam`) pinned first in the grid when complete. `RuntimeViewModel.installLatest`; setup-readiness computed on AppEnvironment; Advanced settings via Library toolbar gear → `AdvancedSettingsSheet`(BackendSettingsView). Sidebar Library/Wine Manager/About. 2 new tests (111 total).

## Decision log
- 2026-06-26 — Use Swift Testing (`import Testing`) not XCTest: bundled in toolchain, keeps zero deps. XCTest is NOT available under Command Line Tools (no Xcode), Testing is.
- 2026-06-26 — Testing under CLT needs framework search paths: `Testing.framework` lives in `$(xcode-select -p)/Library/Developer/Frameworks` and `lib_TestingInterop.dylib` in `.../Library/Developer/usr/lib`. `Scripts/test.sh` adds both via `-F` + `-rpath`. Plain `swift test` fails with "no such module 'Testing'".
- 2026-06-26 — Package `platforms: .macOS(.v15)`; real min OS enforced via Info.plist `LSMinimumSystemVersion=26.0`.
- 2026-06-26 — Custom `URLSession` GitHub-Releases updater instead of Sparkle to keep `Package.swift` dependency-free.

## Known follow-ups (non-blocking)
- DiscoveryEngine skips Windows-style (`C:\...`) library paths in `libraryfolders.vdf`; only host-absolute (`/...`) extra libraries are scanned. In the single-downloader model games land in the primary C: library (always scanned), so this is sufficient for v1. Add Wine `dosdevices` drive-letter translation if cross-drive libraries are needed.
- `.sharedSteamClient` presence symlinks the master Steam into the prefix but does not yet launch a background `steam.exe` inside the prefix; full live-client wiring is a launch-time follow-up (most DRM cases use `.emulatorStub`).

## BLOCKED
- _(none for the build — the items below need a real Wine runtime + on-device launch, not code changes)_
- **Bottle Steam CEF render (THE gate):** does the Windows Steam client's CEF UI actually paint (not a
  black window) with the rebuilt wine (`-fvisibility=default` on CFLAGS **and** CROSSCFLAGS) + the
  `explorer /desktop=` virtual desktop + the steamwebhelper `--single-process` wrapper? This is the
  prerequisite for the whole bottle model and can only be confirmed by launching it. User is rebuilding
  wine via `Scripts/build-wine.sh 26.2.0`.
- **`explorer /desktop=` program-path form:** `launchSteam` passes the macOS **unix** path of `steam.exe`
  as the program arg to `wine explorer /desktop=Silo,<geom>`. If wine's explorer needs a Windows path
  (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe`) instead, Steam won't launch — verify on-device and switch if so.
- **stop() under real Wine:** `stop()` SIGTERMs the loader PID **and** `wine taskkill /F /IM <exe>`. Confirm
  a real game (esp. one with a separate launcher exe) actually exits and isn't orphaned; tune the image
  name if a game's runtime process differs from the launched exe.
- **Cold-start grace:** `play()` waits a flat 10s after cold-starting Steam before launching the game. If
  Steam's first boot (self-update + login) is slower, the game can start before Steamworks is ready — may
  need a readiness probe (Steam pipe/registry) instead of a fixed sleep.
- **GPTK E2E activation:** whether CrossOver wine-cx-26.2.0 loads GPTK's d3d modules via `WINEDLLPATH` (vs
  needing an overlay copy into the wine's own `lib/wine`, Whisky's method) can only be confirmed from a
  real D3D game's launch log.
- Confirm the exact third-party Wine/GPTK runtime repo/release to pin as default (currently placeholder
  `Kegworks-App/Kegworks` in `Silo.defaultRuntimeRepo`; overridable in Settings). Non-blocking.

## Handoff checklist (for human, post-loop E2E)
- [ ] Build the patched wine: `Scripts/build-wine.sh 26.2.0` (adds `-fvisibility=default` + the
      steamwebhelper wrapper). Download/point Silo at a GPTK runtime.
- [ ] Advanced → Steam bottle → **Set up** (installs Windows Steam into the bottle) → **Launch Steam**.
      Confirm the CEF login window actually PAINTS (the gate above); sign in once (Steam caches it).
- [ ] Confirm the library lists games installed in the bottle; **Install** routes a `steam://` URL to the
      running Steam.
- [ ] **Play** → game launches co-resident in the bottle under GPTK (CrossOver fallback); Steamworks/online
      works. **Stop** actually exits it.
- [ ] (Distribution) provide Apple Developer ID + notarization secrets for signed releases.
